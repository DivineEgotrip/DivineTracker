# DivineTracker

Track your chaos in real-time. Log your trips, substances, dosages, and weight—because when it's all over, you're gonna want to remember (or maybe not). No bullshit, just raw data.

keep in mind this is a personal tool that I've made because I could't find anything quite like this (atleast that I found im sure it exists)
